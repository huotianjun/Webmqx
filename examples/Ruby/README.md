The Bunny client library
------------------------

RabbitMQ speaks multiple protocols. This tutorial uses AMQP 0-9-1, which is an open, general-purpose protocol for messaging. There are a number of clients for RabbitMQ in many different languages. We'll use the Bunny, the most popular Ruby client, in this tutorial.

First, install Bunny using Rubygems:
```
$ gem install bunny --version ">= 2.5.1"
```
